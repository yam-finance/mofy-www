## Developing

```bash
yarn install 

yarn dev --open
```

## Building

Before creating a production version of this app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for the target environment. Then:

```bash
yarn build
```

> You can preview the built app with `yarn preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
